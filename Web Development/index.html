    {🚀💻 From Code Chaos to Digital Canvas — I Built My Own Space on the Internet 🌐✨

Ever wondered what happens when curiosity meets caffeine, and they both fall in love with code?
Well… this happens 👇
🎉 anupamyadavanurag.github.io 🎉

Not just a website.
Not just a portfolio.
But my personal tech universe — where every pixel tells a story, and every line of code reflects my growth.

🛠️ Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and deployed on GitHub Pages
🎯 Includes projects in Web Dev, AI/ML, UI/UX, and more
📱 Fully responsive, clean, and made for real humans (not just recruiters 😄)
💡 Bonus: Easter eggs hidden across the site… if you find one, I owe you coffee ☕

➡️ I built this to connect, showcase, and create opportunities — not just for myself, but for every curious mind out there.

If you have 2 minutes, I’d love for you to explore it and tell me:
What’s one thing you’d add or change?

Let's keep growing, one project at a time. 💬💡
And if you’ve built something recently — drop your link too. Let’s celebrate each other’s work! 🙌
